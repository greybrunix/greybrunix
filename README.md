# Hi there ðŸ‘‹:sparkles::blush::rainbow_flag::transgender_flag::sparkles:

## Personal Info

I like funcional programming and low level procedural programming with an hint of imperative programming.<br/>
I use they/them pronouns.

## What I use

* VSC when on windows

### Languages

* C
* Haskell
* Python and Java ( I work with these languages but they bring me no joy )

## Academic Pursuits

Currently focused on OS with a Formal Methods (Group Category) project to do after, and possibly considering Distributed Systems investigation.

Recently finished my OOP project, having made it public in the following [repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/Projeto_POO).

Also have my [Functional Programming repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/pf2022) with a plethra of solved exercises public.
