## Personal Info

I'm Bruno and I study Computer Science at UMinho. <br/>

### Languages

* C
* Haskell
* Python and Java ( I work with these languages but they bring me no joy )

## Academic Pursuits

Currently focused on a Formal Methods project and possibly considering Distributed Systems investigation with a side interest in formal methods investigation and the nature of recursivity.

Recently finished my OOP project, having made it public in the following [repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/Projeto_POO).

Also have my [Functional Programming repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/pf2022) with a plethra of solved exercises public.

Have just finished my [OS project](https://github.com/greybrunix/Projeto_OS), sadly, despite having as many features as possible, all of which are aptly introduced, it was a failure, as a simple String manipulation mistake ruined the functionality of the project, but it might have been my favorite project to do up until now!
