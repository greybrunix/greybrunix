## Academic Pursuits and repos

### Interests
I am currently interested in data storage in Distributed Systems, Formal Methods and Language Processing.
Particularly interested in the correctness of programs and correct programming techniques. </br>
Also interested in how these topics can be applied to Quantum Computing.

I am also currently working on teaching Computer Science as a side project to a friend, material can be found in the pinned repositories.

### Repos

 * [Functional Programming repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/pf2022)
 * [Compiler class projects](https://github.com/greybrunix/PLC) - 20/20
 * [Algorithms and Complexity](https://github.com/greybrunix/AC) (Program verification/specification, Complexity and Data structures)
