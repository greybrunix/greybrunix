# Hi there üëã:sparkles::blush::rainbow_flag::sparkles:

## Personal Info

I'm Bruno and I study Computer Science at UMinho.

I like functional programming and low level imperative programming.

I use they/them pronouns üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà:transgender_flag:.

## What I use

* VI and EX, ed and Emacs
* dwm or i3
* git
* csh and dash
* Check my ![dotfiles](https://github.com/greybrunix/dotfiles) out.

### Languages

* C (Preferencial for structural imperative programming/System level programming)
* Haskell (Preferencial for declarative functional programming)
* CHARITY (Close to replacing Haskell if not for the unfortunate lack of resources)
* Python
* Scheme
* x86 (both IA-32 and x86-64, mostly being used inline in C)

## Academic Pursuits and repos

### Interests
I am currently interested in data storage in Distributed Systems, Formal Methods and Language Processing.
Particularly interested in the correctness of programs and correct programming techniques. </br>
Also interested in how these topics can be applied to Quantum Computing.

I am also currently working on teaching Computer Science as a side project to a friend, material can be found in the pinned repositories.

### Repos

 * [Functional Programming repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/pf2022)
 * [Compiler class projects](https://github.com/greybrunix/PLC) - 20/20
 * [Algorithms and Complexity](https://github.com/greybrunix/AC) (Program verification/specification, Complexity and Data structures)
