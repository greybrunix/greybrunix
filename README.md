# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Personal Info
### General
I'm Bruno GiÃ£o and I'm currently studying Computer Science at UMinho!

Also I go by They/Them, but since Portuguese isn't exactly a "developed" language ðŸ™‚, feel free to use He/Him pronouns.

I have simple tastes, I like cascadia code, I like emacs and arch linux is kinda cool ngl ðŸ™‚
