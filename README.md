# Hi there üëã:sparkles::blush::rainbow_flag::transgender_flag::sparkles:

## Personal Info

I'm Bruno and I study Computer Science at UMinho. <br/>
I like functional programming and low level procedural programming.<br/>
I use they/them pronouns üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà:transgender_flag:.

## What I use

* VSC when on windows
* VIM when on arch ( I will share my .vimrc when I have time )

### Languages

* C
* Haskell
* Python and Java ( I work with these languages but they bring me no joy )

## Academic Pursuits and repos

### Interests
Currently focused on a Formal Methods project and possibly considering Distributed Systems investigation or perhaps Formal Methods.

### Repos
Recently finished my OOP project, having made it public in the following [repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/Projeto_POO).

Also have my [Functional Programming repo](https://github.com/greybrunix/pf2022) with a plethra of solved exercises public.

Have just finished my [OS project](https://github.com/greybrunix/Projeto_SO), sadly, despite having as many features as possible, all of which are aptly introduced, it was a failure, as a simple String manipulation mistake ruined the functionality of the project, but it might have been my favorite project to do up until now!

I will also be soon updating my repo with exercises for the Imperative Programming class, however, this may be redundant since most of the exercises are either written on paper or completely untested somewhere in my arch VM
